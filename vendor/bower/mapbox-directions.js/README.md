Managed as Markdown in `API.md`, following the standards in `DOCUMENTING.md`

## Development

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

The `npm start` task will start up a live-reloading and regenerating development server.

## Building

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-directions.js.git
cd mapbox-directions.js
npm install

This project uses [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to combine
dependencies and installs a local copy when you run `npm install`.
`make` will build the project in `dist/`.
